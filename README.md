# easyNWK Web

This project aims to provide a modern web-based version of the easyNWK.
The easyNWK is an egocentric network visualization tool for social workers and
healthcare professionals based on the book

by Peter Pantuƒçek-Eisenbacher.
This tool supports the collection, reflection, and analysis of contact persons
for social support.

This projects is a follow-up to:

- [easyNWK 1.5](http://www.easynwk.com/) developed in Java 6 by Nikolaus Kelis
- [bachelor project](https://github.com/monitra93/bak2) by Monika Trajkovic
